AI Writing Examiner Project
(IELTS / YKI Style Evaluation System)
1. Project Vision
Build an AI-powered system that evaluates student exam performance similar to official language exams such as IELTS and YKI.

The system will eventually assess four skills:

Writing

Speaking

Reading

Listening

Initial focus: Writing Evaluation (MVP – Minimum Viable Product)

2. Why This Idea Is Strong
Language exams are expensive.

Students need practice before official exams.

Instant AI feedback saves time and money.

High global demand.

Strong portfolio or startup potential.

3. Development Phases
Phase 1 – Writing Evaluator (MVP)
Focus only on writing.

Features:

Student pastes essay.

AI evaluates based on official rubric.

Output includes:

Estimated band score (0–9)

Section breakdown

Detailed feedback

Improvement suggestions

Optional improved version

Estimated Time:
2–3 weeks (1–2 hours daily)

Phase 2 – Web Application Version
Add:

Web interface

Score visualization

Essay saving

Progress tracking

User accounts

Estimated Time:
1–2 months

Phase 3 – Full Multi-Skill System
Add:

Speaking (audio → transcription → evaluation)

Reading (automatic scoring logic)

Listening (audio + answer validation)

Exam simulation mode

Estimated Time:
3–6 months

4. Technical Stack
Current tools:

Python

OpenAI API

Prompt engineering

Structured responses

Future additions:

FastAPI or Flask (backend)

Basic frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

Database

Cloud deployment

5. Team Structure (Mohamed & Ahmed)
Option 1:

Mohamed: Prompt design, rubric research, scoring logic.

Ahmed: Code structure, memory handling, architecture.

Then rotate roles to learn both sides.

6. Timeline Summary
Writing MVP: 2–3 weeks
Web version: 1–2 months
Full system: 3–6 months

Recommended path:
Build Writing MVP → Polish → Convert to Web App.

7. Project Purpose (Learning Mode)
Since this is a learning-focused project:

Goals:

Deep understanding

Clean system design

Prompt engineering mastery

AI evaluation logic

Real-world system thinking

8. Important Reality
AI cannot perfectly replicate official IELTS/YKI grading.

However, it can:

Provide strong feedback

Estimate band levels

Help students improve significantly

That is already valuable.

9. Final Goal
Build:

“AI Writing Examiner v1”

A system that:

Simulates exam grading

Provides structured feedback

Demonstrates real AI engineering capability
