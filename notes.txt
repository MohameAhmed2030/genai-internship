About the job
Overview

Working at Atlassian

Atlassians can choose where they work – whether in an office, from home, or a combination of the two. That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity.

DX's Solutions Engineering Team at Atlassian is seeking a highly skilled and passionate Pre-Sales Solutions Engineer to be a key driver in the growth of the DX product ( getdx.com ). You will serve as the solution expert throughout the sales cycle, dedicated to solving our Enterprise prospects' most complex business problems using our products and solutions, and ultimately helping to close critical deals.

Responsibilities

Lead Technical Evaluations: Partner closely with Account Executives to drive and lead all technical aspects of the sales cycle, including Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) and Pilots, ensuring clear demonstration of platform value and technical feasibility.
Discovery and Strategy: Lead technical discovery sessions to deeply understand client needs, existing engineering workflows, and high-level goals.
Consultative Questioning: Ask thoughtful, detailed questions to uncover critical information about the client’s engineering processes, branching strategies, deployment workflows, and existing tooling.
Solution Design: Design and propose tailored technical solutions for integrating the company's APIs with complex client workflows to meet evaluation success criteria.
Trusted Advisory: Act as a trusted advisor to potential clients, providing strategic guidance on best practices for deployment methodologies and analytics integrations.
Feedback Loop: Capture and synthesize technical feedback from prospects to collaborate closely with the Product and Engineering teams, informing product enhancements and roadmap priorities.


Qualifications

Technical Skills:

Exposure to programming (Ruby/Rails preferred) with a solid understanding of APIs and RESTful services.
Experience with version control systems like Git and the GitHub CLI.
Familiarity with SQL.
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines, deployment workflows, and branching strategies.


Consultative Skills:

Excellent communication and presentation skills, with extensive experience leading high-stakes client discussions and product demonstrations.
Ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear business value.
Strong organizational skills to manage technical follow-ups and resource delivery across multiple active opportunities.


Compensation

At Atlassian, we strive to design equitable, explainable, and competitive compensation programs. To support this goal, the baseline of our range is higher than that of the typical market range, but in turn we expect to hire most candidates near this baseline. Base pay within the range is ultimately determined by a candidate's skills, expertise, or experience.

Role

In the United States, we have three geographic pay zones. For this role, our current base pay ranges for new hires in each zone are:

Zone A: USD 190800 - USD 249100

Zone B: USD 171900 - USD 224425

Zone C: USD 158400 - USD 206800

This role may also be eligible for benefits, bonuses, commissions, and equity.

Please visit go.atlassian.com/payzones for more information on which locations are included in each of our geographic pay zones. However, please confirm the zone for your specific location with your recruiter.
